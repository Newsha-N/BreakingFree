# Breaking Free

# Introduction
This is a new designed Snap Mini for Snap Chat called Breaking Free revolving around youth with incarcerated parents.
Our team created a Snap Mini because of its core design features. It makes it easy for users to listen or share stickers anytime, anywhere, and with anyone. It can be launched in chats where friends can learn and listen to stories together. Also, If we were to expand Breaking Free into an app or website in the future, this can serve as our introduction â€“ similar to the Headspace or HBO Max Mini.
